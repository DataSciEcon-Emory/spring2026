## Course description ##

ECON 725 equips students with essential programming and computational data science skills tailored for economic analysis. Students will learn to use tools like 
Python, Git, Docker, and Cloud Computing to create reproducible workflows, analyze data, and present 
results through dashboards and visualizations. The course also covers machine learning techniques and practical methods for 
deploying models in real-world scenarios. Additionally, students will develop proficiency in SQL and Tableau for data manipulation and visualization. 
A key component of the course is its hands-on practice with data analysis challenges, where students apply the tools and techniques learned to manipulate 
and analyze datasets effectively.


## Learning Outcomes ##

This course will equip students with the skills to create fully reproducible data analysis
pipelines. Upon completing this course, students will be able to acquire, organize, explore, and
construct basic statistical models to analyze economic data and present reports in a dashboard.
By the end of the course, students will be proficient in:

* Developing collaborative, reproducible workflows using Git and GitHub for version
control.
* Running these workflows on a local and remote computers with tools like command line
operations and Github Codespaces.
* Executing workflows in a containerized environment using Docker for comprehensive
reproducibility.
* Implementing workflows in a virtual environment with cloud computing tools.
* Developing dashboards and data visualizations with appropriate software.
* Implementing efficient code in Python following best coding practices.
