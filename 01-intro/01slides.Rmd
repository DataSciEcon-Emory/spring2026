# Introduction


### Course Description 

- This course focuses on programming and data management, with an emphasis on building skills for economic analysis and data science. 
- You will learn how to access and manipulate various types of datasets and will equip you with the skills to create fully reproducible data analysis pipelines. 
- Upon completing this course, students will be able to acquire, organize, explore, and construct basic data science models to analyze economic data and present reports in a dashboard.

# Why this course?

Fill in the gaps left by traditional econometrics and methods classes.

- Practical skills with tools that will benefit your future career.
- Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

Data science skills are highly valuable in private and public sector!

- Data viz, cleaning and wrangling; programming; cloud computation; relational databases; machine learning; etc.

# Set up Checklist

- For this course, we are going to use most of the time cloud computing tools.
- There are several options to choose from, but we are going to use [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), [Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students).
- Before next class, I want you to go over the following checklist:

☑ Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account (This is your first in-class assessment. See Canvas.)
  - You will soon receive an invitation to the course organization on GitHub, as well as [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com), which is how we'll use to submit assignments. 

☑ Create a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) account and a [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) account with Emory email address.
  - Check [Canvas](https://emory.instructure.com/courses/159961/modules/items/3430210) where you will find the link to the group and your first assignment 😊

# Set up Checklist (cont.)

☑ Get Access to [Github Education](https://github.com/education/students) benefits and [Microsoft Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students)

☑ Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - This is the integrated development environment (IDE) that we are going to use in this course in combination with GH Codespaces.

☑ Download [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)
  - This is a fork of VS Code that has AI capabilities built-in.
  
☑ Get Tableau Desktop for Students [here](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation)
  - You will need this for the last module of the course.
